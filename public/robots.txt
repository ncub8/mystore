Disallow: /cart

# Tips:

# Disallow tells a robot not to crawl a page, file, or directory
# Only crawl your most valuable pages
# Don't waste your crawl budget by crawling similar pages
# Do not crawl the parts of your site that aren’t displayed to the public
# Disallowed pages cannot pass PageRank to anywhere else – so any links on those pages are effectively useless from an SEO perspective, so be careful when writing disallow directives
# For example, ecommerce sites might `Disallow` the cart, checkout, and account areas
